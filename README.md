# Nonogram Creation Tool

## What?
Very basic web app for drawing a binary pixelated image and convert it to a nonogram/picross/griddlers/hanjie puzzle.

## How?
Draw an image by clicking or dragging the mouse over the table cells using left click. Use the right mouse button to erase.

## Why?
Hanjie puzzles are fun to solve, so it's nice to have an easy way to make some as well. This is an older project that I just came across again and thought it was worth sharing.
